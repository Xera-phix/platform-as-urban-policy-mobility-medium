    "review":"Love Park is an expansive park in Downtown Philadelphia. There are many sights and monuments. You can spend all day or limit yourself to an hour or so. I would wear good walking shoes and bring a camera to have your picture made under the \"Love Park\" sign. There are many street vendors with drinks and snacks or feel free to bring your own bottle of water. My husband, Son and myself will be going back for sure on our next trip to Philadelphia!",

    "review":"After being pickpocketed in front of Macy's Philly and biking consolant but cheerful back to my car in Fairmount Park to grab more cash -- the only thing now left in my name, I stumbled upon something that totally brightened up my visit: couples of all types, lining up anxiously for a memorable shot in front of Robert Indiana's Love Sculpture.\n\nThere were couples, madly in love, young and old, friends, platonic and borderline lovers, some rekindling the fire after many decades, their progeny now with many children of their own, wanting to know how the fire sparked that caused Mom and Dad to become ONE.\n\nThe image of couples romancing, the line never stopping, made me truly realize that this was too good of an opportunity to let slip by. In life, you either just live by, or you LIVE in it. I chose the latter.\n\nI set up a camera on the platform behind by the water fountain to film time lapse to prove once and for all that while I was there, the line never stopped -- truly all day and night -- there's always some couple approaching or waiting in line to get their picture-perfect shot. If not lovers, there are skaters -- one or the other, people tend to flock to and admire the simple but meaningful iconic image made famous by Robert Indiana.\n\nTo complete the all encompassing emotionally powerful scene, I decided to chat to couples and ask them two simple but sound questions: 1) Where did you guys meet; 2) What are your plans in the City of Brotherly Love.\n\nThe posted video is the results. I hope you find it enlightening as it was for me. Actually the story from one of the couples resoundingly melted my heart. My heart is still in tattered pieces as I mindfully revisit this scene.",

We walked from our hotel to the museums and past Love Park many times ourselves.\n\nAlthough a nice photo (and famous one), the LOVE is actually very small. They make it seem large in photos, but really it\u2019s not very large. It\u2019s in a small park in the center of the street...yes there are homeless, but there are lots of people hanging around (including tons of tourists and weddings taking photos). Never felt unsafe.\n\nI would not go out of my way to see this by any means....but if you are walking past it (as you likely will be) it\u2019s worth stopping for a quick photo.",

    "review":"Love Park (actually formally named JFK Plaza) is a popular and iconic spot in Center City Philly. It is directly across the street to the east from Suburban Station, a rail hub, and there is a parking garage directly beneath the park. There is also a Philly Phlash bus stop on the south side of the park, where visitors can board and ride to a myriad of the city's most famous destinations for a small fee. (The bus runs from April to the end of October.) The City Hall subway stop of both the Broad Street and Market Street lines is right across the street. Bounded by 15th and 16th Streets and JFK Blvd. and Arch Street, diagonally to the northwest from City Hall, it is a place where Center City residents and workers enjoy sitting during lunch hour, where people-watching is a favorite pastime, and where all sorts of interesting --- and yes, sometimes unsavory --- things happen.\n\nDuring the summer, there are noontime concerts of all kinds, from DJs playing dance music that has passersby stopping to join in the dancing, to cool jazz or folk. There's always something to listen to and enjoy. The water in the fountain is often dyed different colors for different causes. It is a great spot to people-watch, read, walk the dog, or just look at the summer flowers.\n\nThe view of the Benjamin Franklin Parkway and City Hall from Love Park is pretty spectacular; you can see all the way up the Parkway to the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and, in the opposite direction, you can view the gorgeous City Hall's magnificent architecture. There are photo opportunities at every turn!\n\nSkateboarding is prohibited in the park now, but this law is pretty much ignored, as young skateboarders are there when the crowds diminish. On weekends, and especially during the winter when the fountain is turned off, skateboarders abound, and they are fascinating to watch.\n\nThere are many homeless people in Philadelphia, and some stake their spots at Love Park. For the most part, they are harmless and do nothing more annoying than panhandling. I would not suggest walking through the park after dark unless there are a lot of other people there, as it is not particularly well-lit at night and there is not a strong police presence most of the time. But the park is generally safe.\n\nFrom Thanksgiving until Christmas Eve, the park is home to the Christmas Village, a lovely little German-inspired village of vendors' huts, with everything from German chocolates and local honey to handmade goods and artwork.\n\nThere is also a year-round information and souvenir building on the site. It is round and looks like a flying saucer. There are green, grassy areas for lazing, cafe tables and chairs by the information building, benches, trees,and beautiful flower gardens throughout the park. There are varying levels in the park and it isn't particularly wheelchair friendly, except right at fountain level (entering from the 16th and Arch Street area), or by entering at either 15th or 16th and JFK Blvd. and not going down to the fountain level, although there are plans to revamp and make it more handicap-accessible in the near future.\n\nLove Park is close enough to the big tourist destinations in the city --- the art museum, the Rodin Museum, the Museum of Natural History, The Franklin Institute, Reading Terminal Market, and Rittenhouse Square --- that it shouldn't be missed.",

When I was young I would have done anything to go visit this park and watch and feel the electricity in the area. Now its just a area for homeless people and their waste. Shame on the city for letting this happen. They had a chance to put skateboard guidelines in place to keep the youth in the are involved and keep the area alive. Now it is scary at night and scary in the day as well. Hopefully the next time my family goes my kids can skate there hassle free. Come on Philadelphia either clean it up right or give it to a group of young people who will take care of it.",

I wanted to take my daughter's picture in front of the statue and a man came over to us and said he would take our picture together. I handed my camera, he took a couple of picutes gave me my camera back and asked for money for doing this. I said thank you, but I wasn't paying him and we walked away. We left the park feeling uncomfortable, but as we were walking the outer edge of the park he was doing it to other people and they were giving him money. Later on at the Rocky Statue we saw him there doing the same thing! We go to NYC often and I have never had people do anything like this. Also the police presence was REALLY lacking.",

Otherwise, there's not much to see\/do in the park. You might want to consider checking out sister cities park on the other side of ben franklin parkway - I thin its more charming and there's an adorable cafe in the center of it now, Milk and Honey that's open till at least 7pm.",

So do you remember this scene from the move \"Spinal Tap\" - Nigel Tufnel is in the middle of a performance, waiting for the life-size Stonehenge prop he designed to come down from the rafters to the oohs and ahs of the audience? The only problem being that when he had sketched out the dimensions he accidentally used the notation for inches instead of feet? So my reaction was the same as Nigel's - stunned at how small this actually was. No idea how it got into my head that this would be much larger. Still cool to see, but otherwise not much to do at the park itself, at least the day I visited. Rock N Roll!",

The homeless can get quite aggressive there and often take up all of the benches and the surrounding low wall that goes around the one side of the park. There are lots of skateboarders at the park who will run you over. Litter is everywhere since the natives are too lazy to put their trash in the numerous trash cans around the park, preferring to just chuck their trash on the ground. The one time of the year when it is a nice place to go is between Thanksgiving and Christmas when the entire park hosts a huge Christmas Market (well, actually, the court has forced the city to say a \"holiday market\") similar to those in Europe. Many of the vendors at that time are from Germany. You could just go to Bethlehem, PA, which is about a 90 minute drive north from Center City Philadelphia and visit probably the best Christkandlemart in the state. Cleaner and safer in Bethlehem, PA.",

The Christmas Village at Love Park was pretty close to being authentic, minus the location of the village. Love Park itself is not too big, so it was a little crammed with all the vendor booths at the village but was still pretty fun.\n\nThey had a German sausages and Gluwine (hot wine) which hit the spot. Also had a booth with authentic german candies, chocolate and more. Cool place to visit for an hour if your in the city.",

He was kind and never asked for money but tips are appreciated. He took good pics give him a tip! This is also stop 6 on the big bus tour and other bus companies stop here too.",

The park is very lively and is utilized by all sorts of people; office workers, skate-boarders, tourists, etc. However, the actual park space is not that big. Even though it's a popular landmark, I don't think it's comparable to the Bean in Chicago in terms of size and space. For me, the park provided a nice recess from exploring the city all day. There was a street performer playing music while I was there. Overall, it's a convenient stop along the way to CIty Hall and Reading Terminal Market.",

This time, we told him we didn't have anything else to give him. He told his wife, \"Tweety Bird,\" that we already gave them something so she could take our picture for no cost (how generous). The statue itself was smaller than I expected, but a great photo op. There was a nice fountain behind it. Tweety Bird took great pictures, but I'm still really annoyed that they were so persistent. I feel like it's a common problem in Philly and that the police should really do something about it so the tourists feel safer. So, go get a picture here, but only take $1.

There are folks walking around offering to take your picture; however, we just asked the people behind us to take our picture and we took a few for them. Go earlier in the day because the sun moves and the sign loses some natural sun light. The one thing I thought was nice is that a line forms so when it is your turn, no one else is in your picture. We didn't spend too much time here but look around as the architecture of the surrounding buildings is beautiful.",

Make sure you catch the Macy's light show in the old Wanamaker building, meeting friends under the eagle.\n\nSince it was chilly, we grabbed some coffees from the local shops and took in the atmosphere of the center of city hall, bustling with workers leaving for the subways and trains. But in the outdoor atrium, there was holiday music and a tree from Delaware County all decked out in its Christmas gear. The modern tables and chairs along with the magnificent architecture hinted of sidewalk caf\u00e9s in Paris. We were in the middle of an island of calm.\n\nThen take in the top of city hall, 22 stories high, under the blessing hand of the 32 foot tall, 54,000 thousand pound statue of William Penn. The trip is times, limited to four persons due to the tiny elevator and costs between $4-8, depending on your age. The ride up, seeing the innards of the building was worth the price of admission. Fantastic girders and stonework, and views could be caught through the glass walled elevator. Children and seniors get a discount. We caught the skyline just at dusk, and Philadelphia looked magnificent. All of us, residents of this region for decades were so proud of our city.\n\nThen, back to Love Park for a bite to eat. We strolled past the newly installed ice skating rink and watched families having fun. The redesigned plaza is so much more inviting and friendly than the old one, with landscaping, and seating, and a little bistro. But onto the Christmas market. Yes, the food is overpriced, but authentic. My favorite is lebercase (hot bologna on a bed of potato salad) and the bratwurst. You definitely get the feel of being in the German festive atmosphere. Then we strolled through the shops, and stopped by Kathie Wohlfarht for our annual fix of genuine German crafts. Yes, it is all overpriced, but having been at the original store inGermany, it was over priced there as well. I did some shopping and thought it is a lot less expensive than a round trip flight to Germany.\n\nWe all left with a genuine appreciation for the city space from above and on the ground. This place is good for all ages, if you want to catch a whiff of something special!",

One guy yelled at me from far away to come and buy something and I ignored it. However, the guy who harassed my fiancee by catcalling got an earful when I went up to his face and told him to shut up and get some teeth (he was missing a lot of teeth). Homeless don't bother me, but they're an issue when they harass others for no reason. Police were there, but were ignoring the homeless completely.

    "review":"Christmas Village is something you should see at least once. This was my second time there as I took an out of town guest. The parking lot below is difficult to find if you are coming the wrong way on the street. However $14 is not so bad to park since the Village entrance is free (you have to go to the information booth to get the $14 price). Be sure to dress warm as it is very cold walking for an hour or two most of it outdoors - hat, gloves, etc. are in order. Items are very high priced so be prepared for this if you want to make a purchase. My gripe is the \"park\" area that the Village is on. It has always bothered my that the marble stone that you walk on are not secure and loose and as you walk they shift. Also look forward when you walk as the area has constant ledges and steps. I have to believe in all of these years that there have been accidents with falls at this event. Another thing I noticed was that there was no police presence in the Village. Suburban events almost always have assigned police officers which is something they should talk to the police department about. If there were any assigned inside the Village they were not seen by myself or guest who were there for about 90 minutes.",

The space earned the nickname \"Love Park\" after a sculpture by Robert Indiana was installed here for the 1976 bicentennial. This sculpture displays red letters LO over VE on a pedestal. It seemed to be a small insignificant work to me, so I became curious about why visitors had formed a short line to photograph it.\n\nI learned later that the sculpture is a favorite photo op in the city with the park's fountain and city buildings in the background and is connected with skateboarding history.The curved granite steps leading down to the fountain attracted skateboarders from around the world in the past and was featured in various magazines and films. But skateboarding has been banned here for years.\n\nThose interested in Philadelphia's more recent history and a photo op may find this to be a worthwhile place to stop. A city welcome center stands at one end of the plaza.",

    "review":"In the mid-1980's a group of young people discovered Vincent Kling's curving steps and ledges to be perfect for skateboarding. It was the combination of the different levels and curves, continuous granite surfaces, and the large space for sessions that attracted skaters. Gradually LOVE Park's reputation spread around the skateboard community as skateboarders from all over the city and surrounding suburbs flocked to LOVE Park. Its close proximity to all major subway and regional rail lines made LOVE so easily accessible to all. All of these factors led LOVE Park to become an icon for the city's youth community. In the early 1990's, with the rising appeal of urban street skating, many of the world's most talented, professional skateboarders decided to make LOVE Park their training grounds. The space quickly became known internationally as one of the finest skate parks in the world and later the \u201cWorld Capitol of Skateboarding.\u201d Tourists came from all over the world to see and skate the famous skate spot. LOVE Park in this period was featured in every major skateboarding\/action sports magazine and was showcased in films by all of the major players of the industry. There is even a popular video game featuring skateboard LOVE Park. In 2000 and 2001, LOVE Park's vast fame brought ESPN's X-Games to Philadelphia. The X-Games brought millions of dollars in tourism and was watched by 150 million households worldwide. Its events and publicity all focused around Philadelphia's skateboard scene, LOVE Park in particular. LOVE's international reputation as an ideal skateboarding locale has been strengthened by the successes of some its most famous users. Internationally known professional skateboarders like Ricky Oyola, Josh Kalis, Stevie Williams, and Anthony Pappalardo made their names in the multibillion-dollar skateboarding industry by being identified with their frequent use of LOVE's famous ledges and stair sets.\nWhile it is now illegal to skate there, many still do. If you get a chance go there and see it! It is history!",

Ask them for their Social Security numbers, so that you can report that income to the IRS.\u263a On a self-guided walking tour, I saw the sign when leaving Masonic Temple. There are a dozen attractions within two blocks of this sign, like Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. It seems, like Rome, all roads lead to this park. The plaza is surrounded by statues and plaques that give a bit of history. View the sign from both sides of the Old Faithful-like fountain. Until Philadelphia imposed a ban in 2002, LOVE Park was the world capital of skateboarding, because of the curved steps. LOVE Park is in the JFK Plaza, at John F. Kennedy Blvd. and North 15th St., northwest of City Hall.",

This is the place to take your loved ones and take your mandatory vacation pictures.\n\nAside from the iconic LOVE sculpture, the park has a fountain where kids and kids-at-heart can play (fun fact: it is allowed to play in public fountains in Philadelphia, that is according to our tour guide, anyway). And it is located near other Philadelphia landmarks.\n\nNow go and take your quintessential Philadelphia pictures!",

I mean, it isn't Mona Lisa small, but the letters are always photographed close up so you don't realize they are rather small and on a raised platform. It was a pretty day when I went, so the view was very nice and colorful with the fountain backdrop.\n\nA couple of things to note for visitors:\n-Lots of homeless, vagrants in the area. I have lived in enough cities to just accept this as par for the course, unfortunate as that may sound, but most of the people who appeared to be panhandlers or whatever you want to call them in this area were circling tourists looking to be of service. If this is new to you, they want a tip if you accept their help. I politely declined the rather large gentleman who followed me a few yards asking to take my photo for me. Other tourists seemed to be doing the same.\n-Lots of bird poop. Just wear some shoes or thicker flip flops. I tend to be more fastidious than most, but with the amount of bird poop and the mist from the fountain giving everything a dusting of moisture, I wasn't keen on walking all over the immediate area for too long.\n-Don't just take one photo of the sculpture! Turn round and round. It is centered in an area with gorgeous buildings. Take advantage of what is in the area.\n-Smile! You're at a statue that is about love!",

This is probably the only time i would be grateful for a selfie stick.\nThe area immediately around the sculpture seemed unkept, rundown and rather uninviting.\nThe fountain was impressive but the whole place needs a makeover in my opinion. I spent less than 10 minutes there. Also watch out the subway station entrance adjoining was a collection point for drug addicts and stunk of urine.\nGood to say you've seen the sculpture i suppose but don't fret if you cannot fit it in.",

Next block over there are photo ops with giant Monopoly Pieces (Iron and Hat) and game pieces (Sorry) and it's in eyeshot of the Reading Railroad. Pretty cool to see.",

This one is on a stand about 6' off the ground. Mind you, the background for this LOVE statute is much nicer with the fountain behind it. The water was coloured a vibrant blue when we were there.\n\nThe small park it is in is a bit sketchy with some troublesome looking folks hanging out. So go during the day. It is a busy tourist area so I was a bit surprised the city doesn't have more of a police presence here.\n\nGreat selfie and photo opportunity, although you do have to line up for a selfie. There is some entertainment there as well - there were two silver Cowboys standing perfectly still until someone approached.",

And we had to stand in a queue to wait for our chance to take a picture with the sign, which is fine because that's the best way everyone can get a chance to click a good picture with the famous sign.

If you do go during this time, at the carnival that happens , do not miss out on their waffles!",

This is a fun way to get into the holiday mood. Drink some of the hot wine from Chaddsford Winery, check out the large assortment of ornaments at Kathe Wohlfahrt, or peruse through the various specialty shops for that one-of-a-kind gift for a loved one. Only a few blocks from the Comcast Building where you can see the Holiday Spectacular or the skating ring and new shops at Dilworth Park. Within walking distance to Macy's Christmas Light show, Dickens Christmas Village, and the Wanamaker Organ. An easy way and low cost way to get into the Christmas mood!",

Along the back walls, they all pelt & sat with large black garbage bags. I thought NYC have a bad homeless issue but never did I think other cities have it far worse!!! Love park was NOT what I expected but the lovely holiday vibe was there to enjoy. The vendors need to know that most people (of various nationalities) are not from the area. We hold funds to make the purchases simply because we are able. One vendor didn't bat an eye of acknowledgment to my question when I asked about the stained glass items. I could've been Obama's keen, it seemed to not had mattered. A word everyone selling goods: MY HARD EARNED MONEY HAS NO COLOR BARRIERS.

Once they were gone, it became a campground for the homeless.

    "review":"When you think of Philadelphia, a few images comes to mind:\n- Liberty Bell\n- Independence Hall\n- The Rocky Balboa steps (for some)\n- Cheesesteaks\n- And the LOVE sculpture.\n\nMy group had limited time to see the touristy stuff, and I made it a point to make this a stop. One person said the Rocky steps had AMOR, but that's not LOVE (in English).\n\nWe came here on a chilly February, and the park was under construction. Our driver dropped us off at the curb of this busy busy area and circled the park. In front of the LOVE sculpture was a trowel and shovels, and the cops told us the mayor was breaking ground to re-do the park. It was going to be a media fest at 11 am, but we didn't have time to hang around for an hour.\n\nWe got a photo of the iconic statue. I would give it 5 stars if parking weren't so difficult.",

The sign is located on the same grounds as City Hall. So if you're looking at the front of City Hall, the LOVE sign will be to your left. You go to the sign and take pictures underneath it. What makes this park more interesting is that there is a live \"Jesus\" also located in the park. This \"Jesus\" character is there almost every day. He wears a robe with a rope belt, his hair is long and he has a beard. He resembles the European version of Jesus that many of us are familiar with. He delivers a message, speaks on scripture, just like Jesus did. He will talk with you and take a picture with you. He's worth seeing. I think he's in the right place. After all wasn't the message of Jesus about LOVE?!",

We tried to explore a little bit but it took too long to walk through even a little section of the park and we couldn't get close enough to any of the vendors to consider buying anything. It seemed like a neat little Christmas marketplace but was unfortunately just too crowded to enjoy at all.

This place has become a popular symbol of the \"city of brotherly love\", his image can be seen in every corner of the city. 20-foot sculpture is very simple - the letter L O V E, put on one another. The area occupied by half a fountain. From the land of streams of water alternately occur in which swarming children of different ages. This is a nice place where you can sit in the summer heat. Since November, at this point, make an ice rink. Decorated trees with lights, music create a romantic atmosphere for skiing. People here are always a lot. Especially in the evening. At Christmas there is fair. Every weekend here there are interesting activities.",

Principal among them are the Weihnachtspyramide (Christmas pyramids with the vanes on top that spin if you light candles below), Schwibb\u00f6gen (hand-carved Christmas arches), and R\u00e4uchermannl (wooden figures that appear to be smoking pipes when you burn an incense cone in their bellies). Several of the event staff are actually German, and speak German, which is very refreshing to hear.\n\nThe park itself has undergone significant renovation, including removal of the fountain. I can't guarantee that you will not not be unaccosted by people who make this park tbeir semi-permanent residence, but go check it out anyway; it's worth a gander. Just don't go alone at night. It can get a wee bit less than comfortable if you're not used to dealing with the kids of folks you find out on the streets at times of day or night, when those who are fortunate have homes are aldeady inside, battened down for the night. Just bring a few friends along, and you should have a fine time. :-)\n\nAlso, it's fun to go around the corner, & visot the giant clothes-pin.

    "review":"The City of Philadelphia has proudly worn this moniker since the time of William Penn in the 17th century. It is therefore fitting that after massive structural renovations the JFK Plaza in Center City near City Hall will now be known as Love Park, proudly fronted by a copy of Robert Indiana\u2019s iconic Love sculpture with the lopsided \u201cO.\u201d I have walked across this plaza innumerable times and went to take a look at the new configuration. With some parts still under construction, dissenting voices are already suggesting that, unlike Philadelphia\u2019s much cherished Rittenhouse Square, the new structure is not a traditional park but a concrete platform that one traverses rather than enjoys. Structural renovation mandated some redesign and the need for greater security might also help explain the rather flat and featureless appearance. I found the new plaza easy to negotiate and while shade providing trees might be missing for now there are ample places to sit under an umbrella, have a coffee or check the messages on one\u2019s cellphone. Eventually two substantial fountains will be added and many programs are being planned to entertain visitors. And similarly to the Rocky statue at the Philadelphia Museum of Art people were lining up to have their photograph taken at at the Love sculpture with the lopsided \u201cO.\u201d\n\nLove Park will be officially dedicated on May 30, 2018. Enjoy your stroll.",

The sign had some people standing around, all being cordial and waiting their turns to take pics. The view from the LOVE sign straight to the Art Museum steps is really incredible. I wish I had a better camera to capture it. The fountain just beyond the sign with the lights was extremely entertaining for our curious 1 year old. He loved running over the lights (just watch the kiddos - staring into those lights would not be a good idea) and it was so hot we let him get as close to the water as he could without getting soaked. One thing to watch out for - lot's of homeless people in the surrounding area! no one bothered us or asked for anything but its always good to be aware. Have fun!",

As a result the city made skateboarding there illegal, and as a result even the designer took a spin through there to show off his skills.\n\nTwo years ago they started renovations with the promise of a new 21st century park. The result, with small and large basin less fountains to delight toddlers and dogs, is a single level granite plane that neither shows off the Love Sculpture to its best nor provides an attractive place for lunch time trysts, summer naps or relaxing breaks to read a book.

Even though the park is in the center of a very busy city, it was as if we were on an island. I enjoyed seeing so many people of many varied ethnic backgrounds. In just the little time I was there I saw people from at least four other countries enjoying the views. It would have been nicer if the sign was bigger.",

The original LOVE sculpture is on exhibit at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. This reproduction sculpture is actually a lot smaller than I anticipated, and much like its newly renovated park which it calls home, was nothing but a let down for me. I didn't feel like waiting for other visitors to get done checking it out to take my own picture so I didn't. I was also feeling sick. History reveals the joy of skateboarding was once had here until the city's \"love\" ordinance banned it from public property in 2003. After a recent renovation, the park from yesteryear is no more now replaced with a flat, sterile lifeless designed slab of concrete.",

    "review":"Having a picture in front of the \u201cLOVE\u201d sculpture is why you come to the Love Park. The park was dedicated in 1967 in remembrance to President John F. Kennedy, a.k.a. \u201cJFK.\u201d\n\nThe sculpture was designed in 1976 by Robert Indiana for Philadelphia\u2019s 1976 Bicentennial. The sculpture became so popular that it became a permanent fixture.\n\nThe square is not very large. A fountain adds some life to the area that was once a skateboarding heaven. Politics took it away making way for a larger ceiling garage which is below your feet. The multi-level park is now just a single, mostly concrete, level with the \u201cLove\u201d sculpture being the major attraction.\n\nA doable walk is the Academy of Natural Sciences; The Franklin Institute; Barnes Foundation and the Rodin Museum. A little further is the Philadelphia Museum of Art where Rocky ran up the 72 steps in the 1976 movie. The famous \u201cRocky\u201d statue is to the right of the steps.\n\nIf you found this review to be \u201chelpful\u201d in any way, please press \u201cLIKE\u201d to let me know.",

We lucked out and there wasn't anyone else really by the sculpture so we had time to take a good amount of pictures\/selfies. On the other end of the park was a water fountain area where kids were playing (it's meant to walk around in and get soaked). There is also an I heart Philly sign which is great for photos. Can get the fountain and City Hall in the background. Would recommend.",
