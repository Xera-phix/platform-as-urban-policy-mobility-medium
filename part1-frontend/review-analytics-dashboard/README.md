## how the data magic happens

- **python sentiment pipeline**  
  all reviews (from tripadvisor, google, yelp) are run through gpt-4 and open-source llms (like mistral & llama 3) to classify each as positive, neutral, or negative. this is done with scripts like `mvp_sentiment.py` and helpers in `/src`.
- **data cleaning & splitting**  
  scripts like `clean_and_split_reviews.py` and `analyze_review_distribution.py` prep the raw data, sort by time period, and handle missing stuff.
- **statistical analysis**  
  pandas + matplotlib for all the stats, boxplots, and period breakdowns. see `tripadvisor_boxwhisker_plot.py`, `tripadvisor_bar.py`, etc.
- **frontend data**  
  `generate_frontend_data.py` and `generate_multiplatform_data.py` crunch the numbers and export everything as json for the dashboard to use.
- **graphs**  
  all the charts you see (timeline, bar, volume) are made in python first, then rendered interactively in the frontend with recharts.
